MaxwellFDFD
===========
MaxwellFDFD is a MATLAB-based solver package of Maxwell's equations.  It solves the equations by the finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method, and hence the name MaxwellFDFD.

See `INSTALL.md` for installation instruction.

See `doc/index.html` in MATLAB or any web browser for more detailed introduction and usage.
