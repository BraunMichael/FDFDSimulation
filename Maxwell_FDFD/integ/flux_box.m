function phi = flux_box(F_cell, box)
% Calculate the net flux of Fx, Fy, Fz through a given box. This function can be
% useful to calculate, for example, div(D) (= rho). However, powerflux_box()
% should not be calculated with this function, because then we need to calculate
% the Poynting vector (which is the flux) everywhere.

% Not implemented yet.
